Welcome! This is a brief tutorial about how to create a simple TypeScript website with Next.js and publish it to Vercel. This is not a deep dive - we won't be digging into complex routing features or making the perfect layout with CSS. This is more of a checklist with steps and resources, with plenty of room for your own creativity & exploration to come through. We'll cover:

- Installing Next.js, local development
- Pages, linking, routing
- Deploying to Vercel

#### Topics covered
- Installing Next.js and setting up for local development
- Next.js Page files
- Next.js `<Link>`, `<Head>` components
- Deploying to Vercel

#### Prerequisites
Familiarity with:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/)

You should have installed:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) (and have some familiarity with GitHub)

#### Primary Resources
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)

## Installation
Open your terminal of choice and run the following command to create a new Next.js project in your current directory:

`~/ROBOT $ npx create-next-app@latest`


You'll go through some choices here, my preferences are highlighted in the output below. Choose all the defaults, **except select "Yes" on the 4th question about the `src/` folder**. Let the tool do its thing. You'll see some output like this:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
  create-next-app@13.1.2
Ok to proceed? (y) y
✔ What is your project named? … my-app
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … No / _Yes_
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … No / _Yes_
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … No / _Yes_
✔ Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … _No_ / Yes
Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/lukebelliveau/ROBOT/my-app.
# ...
Success! Created my-app at /Users/lukebelliveau/ROBOT/my-app
```
<p className="italic text-xs">The step about the `/app` directory is related to [experimental features in Next.js 13.](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals#the-app-directory)</p>

<Spacer />

Next, navigate to the project folder and start up the dev server:

`~/ROBOT $ cd my-app`

`~/ROBOT/my-app $ npm run dev`

<Spacer />

If you see the Next.js intro page, you're good to go! If not, <a href="mailto:hi@lukebelliveau.dev">shoot me a message</a> and I'll take a look.

## Page files

### Adding a new page

Let's add some new pages to share some information about ourselves. Create a new folder named `favorite-colors/` in the `pages/` directory, and add a new file named `index.tsx` inside that folder.

`~/ROBOT/my-app $ mkdir ./src/pages/favorite-colors`
`~/ROBOT/my-app $ touch ./src/pages/favorite-colors/index.tsx`

<Spacer />

Delete the `src/styles/globals.css` file, we don't need it anymore. Remove its import from `src/pages/_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import '@/styles/globals.css' // delete me
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

<Spacer />

At this point, your `src/` folder will look something like this:

<pre>
src
├─ <b>pages</b>
│  ├─ _app.tsx
│  ├─ _document.tsx
│  ├─ index.tsx
│  ├─ api
│  │  └─ hello.ts
│  <b>└─ favorite-colors</b>
│     <b>└─ index.tsx</b>
└─ styles
   ├─ Home.module.css
   └─ globals.css
</pre>

<Spacer />
Let's add some important information to the page:

```tsx
// src/pages/favorite-colors/index.tsx

import Head from "next/head";
import Link from "next/link";

const MyFavoriteColors = () => (
  <>
    <Head>
      <title>My Favorite Colors</title>
      <meta
        name="description"
        content="These are some of my favorite colors!"
      />
    </Head>
    <Link href="https://www.britannica.com/science/color">
      What are colors?
    </Link>
    <p>My favorite colors are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pink</li>
      <li>+</li>
      <li>White</li>
    </ul>
  </>
);

export default MyFavoriteColors;
```

<img src="/images/blog/pink_white.png" alt="Favorite colors screenshot" style={{ width: '30%', marginBottom: '0px' }} />
<p className="italic text-xs">impressive, no?</p>

<Spacer />

We've introduced a few new concepts here:

#### A new [index route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#index-routes)
Creating a file at `pages/favorite-colors/index.tsx` tells Next.js to create a new page for this route. Go to `localhost:3000/favorite-colors`, and you'll see your beautiful new page. Note that you are viewing the component that is **default exported** from the index file.

#### [`<Head>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head)
Append elements to the `<head>` of the page, anywhere. Useful for stuff like page titles, descriptions, and much more.

#### [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)
Handles client-side link transitions. You should always use this component for links in Next.js apps, unless you have a good reason not to (they probably exist, but I can't think of any right now).

### Editing the home page

Let's go back to the `pages/index.tsx` file. Open it up, and you'll see that it contains the code for our default Next.js homepage.

<Spacer />
**The component that is default exported from this file will be rendered as the home page**. That's because `pages/index.tsx` is the index file in the root of the `pages/` folder.
