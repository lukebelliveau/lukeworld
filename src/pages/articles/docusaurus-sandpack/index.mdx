export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

_This was my interactive code solution when my blog was built with Docusaurus. Though my build is a bit simpler now (using Next.js with MDX page files), this may come in handy for somebody else!_

In my experience, the primary reason to start a programming blog is to introduce
yourself to a handful of new technical problems, solve some of them, then forget about
the blog in about a week. Before I forget about this blog, I'm gonna show you
how to do this:

<Sandpack 
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js": helloWorld,
  }}
  options={{
    showNavigator: true,
  }}
/>


By writing markdown (technically `.mdx`) like this:

````jsx
<SandpackSnippet>

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</SandpackSnippet>
````
