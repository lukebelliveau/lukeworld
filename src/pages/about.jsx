                specialist for TypeScript, node, React, and Redux. I also got

                reminiscent of the systems at Netflix, they needed somebody with
                system design & architecture chops, paired with the front-end
                skills to build out their management consoles. I enjoyed working
                on the Java frameworks & services that were consumed by our
                application developers to build, test & deploy their
                applications. I also had the opportunity to build out GUIs for
                our Site Reliabililty Engineers to expose simple network
                controls and insights for use in outages and other times of
                crisis. In my last major project, I completed the research &
                architecture proposal for a new notifications platform. This was
                to facilitate notification management across push/SMS/email at
                Grubhub, and involved architecture designs with a Java backend +
                TypeScript frontend + Cassandra database. Following a review
                process of the architecture plans and DB schemas, my design was
                approved by our org-wide architecture review council, and we
                began work on it the next week.

                In January 2020, I took stock of my 4-year career and decided to
                take a sabbatical. After wrapping up at Grubhub, I embarked to
                go backpacking around Europe, blissfully unaware of how the year
                would unfold! I spent a few months volunteering at a hostel in
                Hungary until the pandemic happened and the world shut down.
                Hunkered down in Budapest, I took on shorter term software
                contracts to pay rent as we waited for our hostel to open back
                up - an event that unfortunately never came to fruition. Not
                quite the year I planned for, but I did manage to fall in love
                with a new city! As we sat inside all year, I took on some
                shorter term software contracts to pay the rent. Among these was
                a stint with the Software Freedom Conservancy, for whom I

                also manage automated deployment pipelines using AWS EC2 +
                Jenkins, and introduced a comprehensive practice of full-suite

                share features modeled after Google Docs. Users are assisted by
                a deep interaction and collision detection engine, which
                provides immediate feedback on the current state of the
                user&apos;s work. The tool runs entirely in the browser and was
                built with React, Redux, Next.js, and Firebase - with support
                from Airtable and Contentful. I am especially proud of the
                smooth Builder interface, convenient auto-saving/sharing
                features, and an optimized build/deploy strategy that keeps
                first paints and JS bundles light, (+ Lighthouse scores high!)
                despite the rich feature set of the full application.
